# Introduction

Aethermark is a **feature-rich, minimalist Markdown system** designed to create clean, expressive content — with syntax that looks great even before rendering.

Whether you're writing docs, notes, posts, or anything in between, Aethermark gives you more with less.

## Getting Started

You can start using Aethermark just like any standard Markdown library — but with a few powerful enhancements built-in.

### What you'll need

- **Python** 3.7 or higher
- A standard text editor or Markdown-capable environment
- (Optional) A build system if you’re integrating with other tools

## Install Aethermark

To install the latest release from PyPI:

```bash
pip install aethermark
```
